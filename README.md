Django on OpenShift
===================

This git repository helps you get up and running quickly w/ a Django
installation on OpenShift.  The Django project name used in this repo
is 'openshift' but you can feel free to change it.  Right now the
backend is sqlite3 and the database runtime is found in
`$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/sqlite3.db`.

Before you push this app for the first time, you will need to change
the [Django admin password](#admin-user-name-and-password).
Then, when you first push this
application to the cloud instance, the sqlite database is copied from
`wsgi/openshift/sqlite3.db` with your newly changed login
credentials. Other than the password change, this is the stock
database that is created when `python manage.py syncdb` is run with
only the admin app installed.

On subsequent pushes, a `python manage.py syncdb` is executed to make
sure that any models you added are created in the DB.  If you do
anything that requires an alter table, you could add the alter
statements in `GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/alter.sql` and then use
`GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy` to execute that script (make
sure to back up your database w/ `rhc app snapshot save` first :) )


Running on OpenShift
--------------------

Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/

Install the RHC client tools if you have not already done so:
    
    sudo gem install rhc

Create a python-2.6 application using this repository

    rhc app create -a django -t python-2.6 --from-code git://github.com/openshift/django-example.git

Admin user name and password
----------------------------
The `admin` user's password will be stored in
`${OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR}/CREDENTIALS` on the gear.
You can use `ssh` directly, or `rhc ssh django` to connect to the gear.
